# Netflix Titles – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the Netflix Titles dataset to understand trends in movies and TV shows available on the platform. The analysis focuses on identifying content patterns, country-wise distribution, genre dominance, release year trends, ratings, and other factors that influence the global content landscape.

The goal of this project is to apply practical data-analysis skills using Python and to demonstrate the ability to clean data, handle missing values, visualize insights, and structure an end-to-end EDA project in a professional format suitable for portfolios and resumes.

Key highlights of the analysis:

--Cleaned and prepared the Netflix dataset for analysis

--Performed exploratory data analysis using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

--Visualized patterns in content type (Movies vs TV Shows)

--Identified top countries and genres contributing to Netflix's library

--Analyzed release year trends to understand how Netflix content evolved

--Examined distribution of movie durations and ratings

--Exported all visualizations into a structured outputs/figures/ folder

--Organized the project into industry-standard folders (data, notebooks, outputs)

This project demonstrates core data-analysis skills: data cleaning, visualization, feature understanding, and storytelling with insights.
